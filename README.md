# styled-jsx

Full, scoped and component-friendly CSS support for JSX (SSR + browser).

## Features

- Full CSS support, no tradeoffs in power
- Runtime size of just **500 bytes**
- Complete isolation: Selectors, animations, keyframes
- Built-in CSS-prefixing
- Very fast, minimal and efficient transpilation (see below)
- High-performance runtime-CSS-injection when not server-rendering
- Future-proof: Equivalent to server-renderable "Shadow CSS"
- Works like the deprecated `<style scoped>`, but the styles get injected only once per component

## Usage

Firstly, install the package:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev styled-jsx
```

Next, add `styled-jsx/babel` to `plugins` in your babel configuration:

```json
{
  "babel": {
    "plugins": [
      "styled-jsx/babel"
    ]
  }
}
```

As the last step, simply include `<style jsx>` in your code:

```js
export default () => (
  <div>
    <p>only this paragraph will get the style :O</p>
    { /* you can include <Component />s here that include
         other <p>s that don't get unexpected styles! */ }
    <style jsx>{`
      p {
        color: red;
      }
    `}</style>
  </div>
)
```

## How It Works

The example above compiles to the following:

```js
import _jsxStyleInject from 'styled-jsx/inject'

export default () => (
  <div>
    <p data-jsx='cn2o3j'>only this paragraph will get the style :O</p>
    { _jsxStyleInject('cn2o3j', `p[data-jsx=cn2o3j] {color: red;}`) }
  </div>
)
```

### Why It Works Like This

Data attributes give us style encapsulation and `_jsxStyleInject` is heavily optimized for:

- Injecting styles upon render
- Only injecting a certain component's style once (even if the component is included multiple times)
- Keeping track of styles for server-side rendering (discussed in the next section)

## Server-Side Rendering

In the server rendering pipeline, you can obtain the entire CSS text of all the combined components by invoking `flush`:

```js
import flush from 'styled-jsx/flush'

// …
// <render here>
// …

const styles = flush()

for (let id in styles) {
  const css = styles[id]
  console.log(id, css)
}
```

This API is also available on the client: Instead of returning the CSS text, it returns a reference to the automatically generated `<style>` tag.

This is useful for performing diffs of elements between top-level `render()` calls, and ditching style elements that are no longer being used.

- **Sunil Pail** ([glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor)) inspired the use of `murmurhash2` (minimal and fast hashing) and a efficient style injection logic.
- **Sultan Tarimo** built [stylis.js](https://github.com/thysultan), a super fast and tiny CSS parser and compiler.
- **Max Stoiber** ([styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components)) proved the value of retaining the familiarity of CSS syntax and pointed me to the very efficient [stylis](https://github.com/thysultan/stylis.js) compiler (which we forked to very efficiently append attribute selectors to the user's css)
- **Yehuda Katz** ([ember](https://github.com/ember)) convinced me on Twitter to transpile CSS as an alternative to CSS-in-JS.
- **Evan You** ([vuejs](https://github.com/vuejs)) discussed his Vue.js CSS transformation with me.
- **Henry Zhu** ([babel](https://github.com/babel)) helpfully pointed me to some important areas of the babel plugin API.
